# Trunk Recorder MQTT Status (and Units!) Plugin <!-- omit from toc -->

This is a plugin for Trunk Recorder that publish the current status over MQTT. External programs can use the MQTT messages to collect and display information on monitored systems.

Requires trunk-recorder 4.7 (commit 837a057 14 NOV 2023) or later, and Paho MQTT libraries

- [Install](#install)
- [Configure](#configure)
- [MQTT Messages](#mqtt-messages)
- [Trunk Recorder States](#trunk-recorder-states)
- [MQTT Brokers](#mqtt-brokers)
  - [Mosquitto MQTT Broker](#mosquitto-mqtt-broker)
  - [NanoMQ](#nanomq)
- [Docker](#docker)

## Install

1. **Clone the 5.0 RC release branch of Trunk Recorder** following these [instructions](https://github.com/robotastic/trunk-recorder/blob/master/docs/INSTALL-LINUX.md).
   
2. **Install the Paho MQTT C & C++ Libraries**.

&emsp; If your package manager provides recent Paho MQTT libraries, e.g:

```bash
sudo apt install libpaho-mqtt-dev libpaho-mqttpp-dev
```

&emsp; If not, you may build and install these libraries from source:

&emsp; - _Install Paho MQTT C_

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c.git
cd paho.mqtt.c

cmake -Bbuild -H. -DPAHO_ENABLE_TESTING=OFF -DPAHO_BUILD_STATIC=ON  -DPAHO_WITH_SSL=ON -DPAHO_HIGH_PERFORMANCE=ON
sudo cmake --build build/ --target install
sudo ldconfig
```

&emsp; - _Install Paho MQTT C++_

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.cpp
cd paho.mqtt.cpp

cmake -Bbuild -H. -DPAHO_BUILD_STATIC=ON
sudo cmake --build build/ --target install
sudo ldconfig
```

3. **Build and install the plugin:**

&emsp; This pluigin source should be cloned into the `/user_plugins` directory of the Trunk Recorder 5.0+ source tree.  It will be built and installed along with Trunk Recorder.

```bash
cd [your trunk-recorder github source directory]
cd user_plugins
git clone https://github.com/taclane/trunk-recorder-mqtt-status --branch test/autobuild
cd [your trunk-recorder build directory]
sudo make install
```

&emsp; **NOTE:** Plugins will be automatically built and installed with Trunk Recorder.  To update either Trunk Recorder or a plugin, simply `cd` into the appropriate git directory and `git pull`.  Refer to the above instructions to `make install` any updates.

**Plugin Usage:**

See the included [config.json](./config.json) for an example how to load this plugin.

```json
    "plugins": [
    {
        "name": "MQTT Status",
        "library": "libmqtt_status_plugin.so",
        "broker": "tcp://io.adafruit.com:1883",
        "topic": "robotastic/feeds",
        "unit_topic": "robotastic/units",
        "username": "robotastic",
        "password": "",
        "console_logs": true,
        "mqtt_audio": false,
        "mqtt_qos": 0,
    }]
```

If the plugin cannot be found, or it is being run from a different location, it may be necessary to supply the full path:

```json
        "library": "/usr/local/lib/trunk-recorder/libmqtt_status_plugin.so",
```

## MQTT Messages

The plugin will provide the following messages to the MQTT broker depending on configured topics.

\* Some messages have been changed for consistency. Please see links for examples and notes.  
\*\* `end` is not a trunking message, but sent after trunk-recorder ends the call. This can be used to track conventional non-trunked calls.

## Trunk Recorder States

Trunk Recorder uses state definitions to manage call flows, recorder assignment, and demodulator operation. The MQTT plugin will include this information when possible. Below is a summary of these states, but not all may appear in MQTT messages.

**call_state** / **rec_state**
| State | State Type   | Description                                                                                                |
| :---: | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   0   | `MONITORING` | Call: Active - No recorder is assigned - See **mon_state** table                                           |
|   1   | `RECORDING`  | Call: Active - Recorder is assigned<br>Recorder: Assigned to call [Recording] - Demodulating transmissions |
|   2   | `INACTIVE`   | Recorder: Assigned to call [Disconnecting] - Detaching from source and demodulator                         |
|   3   | `ACTIVE`     | Recorder: Assigned to call [Tuned] - Not recording yet                                                     |
|   4   | `IDLE`       | Recorder: Assigned to call [Squelched] - Not recording, has not timed out                                  |
|   6   | `STOPPED`    | Recorder: Not assigned to call - Returning to `AVAILABLE` state                                            |
|   7   | `AVAILABLE`  | Recorder: Not assigned to call - Free for use                                                              |
|   8   | `IGNORE`     | Recorder: Assigned to call [Ignoring] - Ending call after unexpected data on the voice channel             |

**mon_state**
| State | State Type    | Description                                                                                                                      |
| :---: | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   0   | `UNSPECIFIED` | Default state                                                                                                                    |
|   1   | `UNKNOWN_TG`  | Not recording: `recordUnknown` is `false` and talkgroup is not found in the _talkgroup.csv_ (\*not currently implemented)        |
|   2   | `IGNORED_TG`  | Not recording: Talkgroup has the ignore priority (`-1`) set in the _talkgroup.csv_                                               |
|   3   | `NO_SOURCE`   | Not recording: No source exists for the requested voice frequency                                                                |
|   4   | `NO_RECORDER` | Not recording: No recorders are available or talkgroup priority is too low                                                       |
|   5   | `ENCRYPTED`   | Not recording: Encryption indicated by trunking messages or mode field (`E`,`DE`,`TE`) in the _talkgroup.csv_                    |
|   6   | `DUPLICATE`   | Not recording: [multiSite] This call is a duplicate of a prior call                                                              |
|   7   | `SUPERSEDED`  | Not recording: [multiSite] This call is a duplicate of a subsequent call with a site precedence indicated in the _talkgroup.csv_ |

## MQTT Brokers

### Mosquitto MQTT Broker

The [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org) MQTT is an easy way to have a local MQTT broker. It can be installed from a lot of package managers.

This broker does not impose a limit on the length of MQTT messages, and will handle packets up to 256 MB in size by default. 

Starting it on a Mac:

```bash
/opt/homebrew/sbin/mosquitto -c /opt/homebrew/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
```

### NanoMQ

The [NanoMQ](https://nanomq.io) broker is a lightweight alternative, but additional configuration may be required for Trunk Recorder systems with a large number of recorders or heavy call volume. 

This broker **does** impose a limit on the length of MQTT messages, and the `max_packet_size` default of 10 KB may generate `MQTT error [-3]: Disconnected` errors with this plugin. 

```
# #============================================================
# # NanoMQ Broker
# #============================================================

mqtt {
    property_size = 32
    max_packet_size = 10KB
    max_mqueue_len = 2048
    retry_interval = 10s
    keepalive_multiplier = 1.25
...
```
[Editing `/etc/nanomq.conf`](https://nanomq.io/docs/en/latest/config-description/mqtt.html) and increasing the packet size to 100 KB or more should be sufficient for MQTT messages generated by this plugin. If `mqtt_audio` is enabled packet size will need to be raised significantly.

## Docker

The included Dockerfile will allow building a trunk-recorder docker image with this plugin included.

`docker-compose` can be used to automate the build and deployment of this image. In the Docker compose file replace the image line with a build line pointing to the location where this repo has been cloned to.

Docker compose file:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  recorder:
    build: ./trunk-recorder-mqtt-status
    container_name: trunk-recorder
    restart: always
    privileged: true
    volumes:
      - /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb
      - /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus
      - /var/run/avahi-daemon/socket:/var/run/avahi-daemon/socket
      - ./:/app
```
